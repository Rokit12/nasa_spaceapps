                <small>NASA trained astronauts Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldin at Cinder lake Crater field and Grand Canyon in Arizona to Map the area & collect geological specimens and simulate the lunar landing site on the Moon at Mare Tranquillitatis. They were also trained at Sierra Blanca, Texas to gather rock specimens using special lunar geological tools to pick the samples. While LRO(Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter) mission is automated to map the landing sites and locate potential resources on the moon.</small>
               <br/>
               <br/>
                <small>The lunar prospector mission also checked for possible deposits of polar ice and measured the magnetic field similarly to NASA scientists studying planetary rocks.</small>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <small>In the Apollo 11 mission astronauts were trained by NASA on how to collect geological specimens, how to enter and exit the lunar module. The astronauts were also trained how to gather and study rock samples which they also carried out at Nevada National security Site, Nevada to collect samples of exploded and ancient volcanic formations resembling the  Timber Mountain Caldera on the Moon. The rocks and lunar regolith were brought to the earth for study.</small>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <small>Also in the Apollo 17 mission, an Unshocked lunar rock was discovered which shows that the moon had a dynamo-generated magnetic field with orange soil containing volcanic glass. Rocks from the Apollo Missions include Apollo 15 Basalt, Apollo 16 Anorthosite, Apollo 17 Breccia. </small>
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <small>Without forgetting the Lunar reconnaissance orbiter(LRO) mission which was used to find safe landing sites on the moon 
                    surface.</small>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                <small>The data connection between the astronauts undertaking training on the earthâ€™s surface before the introduction of innovative instruments creates an effective field of research.
